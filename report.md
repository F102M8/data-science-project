## Introduction

With the video game industry growing day by day, peneterating our lives more and more, we decided to work on analyzing them based on the data on Steam DB website targetting their 24 hour player peak. 24 hour player peak, as the feature to be modeled by other criteria, demonstrates what is the maximum number of players playing a certain game concurrently in each day. In this project-assignment, we delve into how data was extracted, modified, and employed so that predictive models could form addressing 24 hour player peak.
